# StackOverflow

Deployed the web app to Heroku, here is the link:
https://rocky-inlet-38763.herokuapp.com/



Here is a testing account that you can play with:

AccountNumber:  aaa

Password: 123 



My Heroku is using a free account, so when you log in at the first time,
it is a little slow. Maybe it requires about 10 seconds to log in, but it would be good after the first time log in.


Technical Stack: REACT, REDUX, NODE.JS, MONGODB, HEROKU
§ Implemented a customized StackOverflow which can log and visualize different types of user behaviors, and provides
relevant recommendations based on user’s posts. Used MongoDB as the database and Heroku for deployment.

§ Back-end: Used a Python scraping library (Beautiful Soup 4.2.0) to scrape Java programming wikis and Apache Solr
to index scraped content and provide matching capabilities.

§ Front-end: Implemented StackOverflow webpage simulation and interactive user behaviors charts. Also, listed top
10 relevant wiki sources for user’s post.
