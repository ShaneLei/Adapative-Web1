## Overview
Implemented a customized StackOverflow which can log and visualize different types of user behaviors, and provides
relevant recommendations based on userâ€™s posts. Used MongoDB as the database and Heroku for deployment.

Here is a testing account that you can play with:
* AccountNumber:  aaa
* Password: 123 

Note: My Heroku is using a free account, so it will be a liitle slow when you log in for the first time. Please wait for around 10 - 20 seconds for Heroku to launch and activate the web app.
